  types of hooks ...
   
     a) useState()
     b) useEffect()
     c) useRef()
     d) useReducer()
     e) useFetch()
     f) useMemo()
     g) custom hook



     a) useState() : useState is an type of hooks inside of react js 
                     useState is used to destructured of data in array 
                     useState is used to stored data in object | array | string | boolean | numbers etc.
                     useState is also used data one components to another 
                     useState is also used to add | modify | and update data.
                     
                     examples : import React,{useState} from 'react'


      b) useEffect(): use effect is a type of hooks inside of react js 
                      useEffect is used to fetch data and applied a effects and did counts app etc.
                      useEffect provides dependency to render data 
                      
                      syntax :

                       useEffect(()=>{statements},dependency);

                       Note : dependency is passed three way inside of use effects 
                              
                              
                        1) no dependency :   useEffect(()=>{statements});
                                Note : render data again and again 

                                        
                        2) pass [] array as dependency :   useEffect(()=>{statements},[]);
                                Note : render data once time
                                
                        3) pass a props and state data as dependnecy :         
                                useEffect(()=>{statements},[props,state]);
                                Note : render data once time and we can update inside of data        



    3) useRef : useRef() is type of hook inside of react js
                useRef is used to pass reference of user input
                useRef is used tp stored a data from user input
                
                examples : import React,{useRef} from 'react'

                const name=useRef("");

                <input type="text" ref={name} placeholder="Name *" />
